We have very little time
And if we use direct lines, then we have one paragraph.

    This is code
This is [an example] [id] reference-style link.

This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") inline link.

[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.

[id]: http://example.com/  "Optional Title Here"

``There is a literal backtick (`) here.``

regular paragraph.

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
